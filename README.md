# BBK-Applied-ML
## Applied Machine Learning projects at Birkbeck Data Science MSc.
This is my first end-to-end ML project. The objective is to build a a Cyber Threat Detection system to distinguish between normal WiFi traffic and "bad" traffic or attacks. The attacks focussed on hereare impersonation attacks such as Hirte, Honeypot and EvilTwin.

My coursework uses the Aegean WiFi Intrusion/threat Dataset (AWID2). The creators of the dataset used a physical lab to replicate a typical SOHO (Small Office and Home) infratructure consisting of a nunmber of devices such as laptops, smartphones, tablets and smart Tvs. The data contains a wide range of cyber threats including impersonation attacks, i.e. an attack in which a cybercriminal assumes the identity of a legitimate party.

The coursework involves building a binary classifier capable of distinguishing between the normal and intrusive traffic that could form part of a ML-based wireless Intrusion Detection System (IDS).
